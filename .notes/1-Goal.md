# **Project Overview**

## **Goal**

Recreate the existing personal site at [https://jaypaul-barrow-9cpc180.gamma.site](https://jaypaul-barrow-9cpc180.gamma.site) as a **self-hosted static React site** under the domain `jaypaul.me`, hosted via A2 Hosting.

The new site must:

- Visually and structurally **replicate the Gamma site 1:1**, including layout, fonts, spacing, transitions, and imagery.
- Be **built in React** with **Vite** for fast development and performance.
- Use **TailwindCSS** for styling.
- Be **fully responsive** (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Use **scroll animations and subtle transitions** as sections enter the viewport.
- Be hosted on **A2 Hosting**, deployed via **GitHub CI/CD** pipeline triggered by updates to the `main` branch.

This rebuild is designed to **eliminate Gamma’s ongoing platform costs** while retaining full control and future editability. The final site itself **is the CV**, no downloadable résumé is needed, and there is **no blog**, **no video intro (yet)**, and **no CMS** — just clean, modular, and maintainable code.
