# **Key Features**

The site must replicate the design, structure, and interactivity of the Gamma site with the following core elements:

---

### 1. **Visual and Layout Fidelity**
- Pixel-accurate recreation of Gamma layout
- Matching typography, spacing, colors, and alignment
- Responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop

---

### 2. **Componentized Sections**
Each visible section on the Gamma site will be modularized:
- **Header** with name, role, and navigation (scroll-to-section)
- **About Me / Bio**
- **Experience** (timeline or stacked layout)
- **Projects / Portfolio**
- **Contact / Links** to LinkedIn, GitHub, email, etc.
- **Footer** with name and copyright

---

### 3. **Animations & Transitions**
- Scroll-triggered section transitions (fade-in, slide-up)
- Use TailwindCSS and `@tailwindcss/animate` plugin or IntersectionObserver logic
- Mobile-optimized: no animation should block UX

---

### 4. **Asset Optimization**
- Images and icons scraped from Gamma, optimized for web (use WebP where possible)
- All static assets served from local `public/` directory

---

### 5. **SEO & Meta**
- Clean semantic HTML5 structure
- Meta tags for:
  - Title and description
  - Open Graph (for LinkedIn/Facebook shares)
  - Favicon and mobile icons

---

### 6. **Performance**
- Lightweight bundle (Vite + Tailwind tree-shaking)
- No external tracking or heavy libraries
- Lazy load animations and images where possible

---

### 7. **Future-Ready Design**
- Video intro section built as a hidden placeholder
- Modular component layout for easy updates later
- 404 route fallback
